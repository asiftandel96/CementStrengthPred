  Data Description:-
  
  Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing 
corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database. 

Name | DataType | Measurement | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------  
Cement (component 1) | quantitative | kg in a m3 mixture | 
Blast Furnace  | quantitative | kg in a m3 |  Blast furnace
Slag (component 2) |          | mixture | slag is a nonmetallic coproduct produced in the process. It consists primarily of silicates, aluminosilicates, and calcium-alumina-                                                 silicates
Fly Ash (component 3) | quantitative | kg in a m3 mixture | It is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven                                                                out of coal-fired boilers together with the flue gases.
